/* ======================================================================
   SHARED CHARACTER DATA — used by BOTH script.js (desktop) and
   script-mobile.js (mobile), so you only edit a character's message,
   color, icon, or font ONCE and it's correct on both layouts.

   BALLOON FONT SIZE IS FULLY MANUAL — nothing auto-shrinks or auto-grows
   anymore. Each character has its own balloonFontSize (desktop) and
   balloonFontSizeMobile (mobile). If a message doesn't fit nicely in the
   balloon, edit that character's number directly — that's the only
   thing that controls it now. The mobile numbers below are reasonable
   starting points (roughly sized to each message's length) — nudge them
   however you like.
